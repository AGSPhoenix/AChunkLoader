# A Chunk Loader
A 1.11 Minecraft Forge Chunk Loader

cfg fields:
chunkLoaderSize defines how many chunks square are loaded around where the loader is placed. This should be an odd number.
playerInactivityTimeout defines how long (in hours) after a player has logged out before disabling their chunk loaders. With the default of 0 this feature is disabled.

As of v1.1.0 chunks in all dimensions will be loaded at server start as long as they are enabled
