# A Chunk Loader [![](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_a-chunk-loader_downloads.svg)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/a-chunk-loader)
A 1.11.2 Minecraft Forge Chunk Loader

The default chunkLoaderSize is 5x5 chunks (25 chunks)

Your chunks will now load at server start no matter where they are (Added in v1.1.0)

You can use the server command '/ACL-stats' to see how many chunks are being loaded (Added in v1.2.0)

_cfg fields_
- **chunkLoaderSize** defines how many chunks square are loaded around where the loader is placed. This should be an odd number.
- **playerInactivityTimeout** defines how long (in hours) after a player has logged out before disabling their chunk loaders. With the default of 0 this feature is disabled.
